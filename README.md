This is a personal project. As a student at AU I've repeatedly heard people ask what was being served at the cafe. Most of the time the other people pulled up the cafe menu website on their phone and looked it up. It would almost be faster to run over to the cafe and see what they were serving than to wait for the website to load.
Native apps usually load faster than web pages do, so why doesn't the cafe have a menu app? Well now they will, however unofficial it may be.

The main reason that I'm putting this on here is for portfolio. However if you decide that you want to expand on the work that I've done, feel free to fork the project and work in it.
